							<h3>Samagra Shiksha</h3>

							<p style="text-align:justify">Samagra Shiksha is an overarching programme for the school Education sector extending from pre-school to class 12 and has the broader goal of improving school effectiveness measure in terms of equal opportunities for schooling and equitable learning outcomes. It envisages the ‘school’ as a continuum from pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary to senior secondary levels</p>

                            <h2>Benifits</h2>        
                           </p>
							<p style="text-align:justify">The Scheme will help improve the transition rates across the various levels of school education and aid in promoting universal access to children to complete school education. The integration of Teacher Education would facilitate effective convergence and linkages between different support structures in school education through interventions such as a unified training calendar, innovations in pedagogy, mentoring and monitoring, etc. This single Scheme will enable the SCERT to become the nodal agency for conduct and monitoring of all in-service training programmes to make it need-focused and dynamic. It would also enable reaping the benefits of technology and widening the access of good quality education across all States and UTs and across all sections of the society</p>
